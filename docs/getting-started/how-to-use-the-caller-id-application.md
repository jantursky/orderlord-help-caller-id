## How to use the Driver application
- once the courier will log into the Driver application, he needs to select, if he is in the store or on the way. Once, he will select one of the options, his status will be updated in the **DMS**, **POS** and **KDS** application and he will be ready to accept assigned deliveries.

{% include img_smartphone.html name="getting_started_how_to_use_the_caller_id_screen_1.png" %}

- the [**List of deliveries**](#description-of-the-list-of-deliveries) screen will be displayed, reloaded with the latest data. The courier needs to wait, until the manager or the dispatcher will assign him the delivery with the orders.

{% include img_smartphone.html name="getting_started_how_to_use_the_caller_id_screen_2.png" %}

- once he will receive a newly assigned delivery, the **Accept screen** will be displayed. On this screen, he could see the preview of all orders for this delivery. He needs to decide if he wanted to **ACCEPT** or **DECLINE** this delivery. The accepting the delivery is very easy - the courier just needs to hold the **white circle** in the middle of the bottom screen and depending on his action, move it to {% include icon.html name="chevron_left" %} the left or {% include icon.html name="chevron_right" %} right. <span class="text-red-200">For some accounts, the option **DECLINE** could be hidden. This is because of the set up of the account. In such case, you need to ask the administrator of the account (_you need to ask for the access_)</span>

{% include img_smartphone.html name="getting_started_how_to_use_the_caller_id_screen_3.png" %}

- if the courier accepts the delivery, this delivery will be listed on the screen **List of deliveries**. Before he starts this delivery, he could start picking up the meals for these orders under the delivery. For instance, for the order **#001**, if the courier wants to check, what meals he needs to pick up, he just needs to hold the finger on this row, and the list of meals will be listed.

{% include img_smartphone.html name="getting_started_how_to_use_the_caller_id_screen_4.png" %}

- once the [**List of meals**](#description-of-the-list-of-meals) is displayed, the courier can by clicking on the rows keep the log, what he picked up and what is not. Once he is done with picking up the meals, he could close this dialog by click on the **BACK** button or by clicking outside the list area.

{% include img_smartphone.html name="getting_started_how_to_use_the_caller_id_screen_5.png" %}

- the courier has also the option to preview the details of the order before he will **START THE DELIVERY**. He could do that by a single click on the row with the order. Once the courier is done with checking the details of the order, he could close this screen by clicking on {% include icon.html name="arrow_back" %} the **BACK ARROW** in the top-right corner or by the **BACK** button.

{% include img_smartphone.html name="getting_started_how_to_use_the_caller_id_screen_6.png" %}

<!-- {% include img_smartphone.html name="getting_started_how_to_use_the_caller_id_screen_7.png" %} -->

- once the courier wants to **START THE DELIVERY**, he could do that by holding the **white circle** in <span class="text-green-100">the green label</span> on the bottom side of the block of the delivery. Once the courier holds the circle, he needs to swipe to the right side to **START THE DELIVERY**. During this starting procedure, the update mechanism will be triggered once again, just to be sure that the courier has the latest updated orders for all assigned deliveries.

{% include img_smartphone.html name="getting_started_how_to_use_the_caller_id_screen_7.png" %}

- the new screen [**Order on the map**](#description-of-the-order-on-the-map) will be displayed. On this screen, the courier could use the navigation to reach the customer, call the customer before the arrival, notify him with the SMS/e-mail and skip or cancel the order. Once the courier gets to the location of the customer, he could notify the manager and the rest, that he **ARRIVED AT CUSTOMER**. He could do that by holding the **white circle** in <span class="text-orange-200">the orange label</span> and swiping to the right. Once he will do that, the status of the order will be changed to the **FINISHED ORDER**

- if the customer is not reachable, the traffic jam occurred or there is another reason, why the courier can't finish the order for the customer, he could skip the order by click on the option {% include icon.html name="redo" %} **skip**. The new dialog will be shown, where the courier has prepared reasons or he could type his own reason, why he can't reach the customer. Only the last order in the list of orders for the delivery can't be skipped, obviously.

- when the courier sends the **SKIP ORDER** reason, the dialog with the list of skipped orders will be listed. It's up to him if he wanted to **GO TO SKIPPED ORDER** or to continue with the next order in the list.

- once the order was skipped or finished by the courier, the screen will automatically focus on the next order (you could notice that by changing **2/2** position with updated order info and map redrawn). The procedure is the same as for the previous order, **ARRIVE** > **FINISH**, etc. 

- but in some cases, the courier needs to cancel the order because of _canceled by customer_ reason or _test order_ reason. He could do that by clicking on the option {% include icon.html name="cancel" %} **cancel**. The new dialog will be shown, where the courier has prepared reasons or he could type his own reason, why he needs to cancel the order.
<span class="text-red-200">For some accounts, the option **CANCEL** the order could be hidden. This is because of the set up of the account. In such case, you need to ask the administrator of the account (_you need to ask for the access_)</span>

- if the courier needs to check the list of meals for the order, he could do that by clicking on the {% include icon.html name="receipt" %} **details** option in the bottom bar.

- the courier could also start the external navigation application. He could do that by clicking on the {% include icon.html name="navigation" %} arrow icon in the top-right screen or the same icon {% include icon.html name="navigation" %} **navigate** in the bottom bar. The external application will be started (if it's installed) and will start the navigation automatically.

- once the courier arrived at the customer, he needs to wait until the customer will come for the meals. When he will get the meals, the courier could change the status of the order as finished. He could do that by holding the **white circle** in <span class="text-green-100">the green label</span> and swiping to the right. The status will be changed, and the manager will be notified, that the order was finished by the courier.

- if the feature **ADD THE TIPS** is enabled for the whole account and the order is going to be paid by **card**, the screen dialog with an option to add a tip from the customer will be displayed. The customer has the option to add the additional tip on the top of the order or no.
<span class="text-red-200">For some accounts, the option **ADD THE TIPS** the order could be hidden. This is because of the set up of the account. In such case, you need to ask the administrator of the account (_you need to ask for the access_)</span>

- if the feature **ADD THE SIGNATURE** is enabled for the whole account and the order is going to be paid by **card**, after finishing the order, the customer needs to add his signature for verification purposes of handing over the order to the customer. The new screen will be displayed, where the customer signs the order and click on the button <span class="text-green-100">**SAVE**</span>.
<span class="text-red-200">For some accounts, the option **ADD THE SIGNATURE** the order could be hidden. This is because of the set up of the account. In such case, you need to ask the administrator of the account (_you need to ask for the access_)</span>

- if the courier finishes all the orders for the delivery (whether officially **finished** or **canceled**), the dialog with the short summary will be displayed. The courier needs to click on the <span class="text-green-100">**RETURN TO STORE**</span> button.
